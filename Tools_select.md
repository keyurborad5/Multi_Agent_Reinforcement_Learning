## 1. Recommended Physics-Based Simulator
Given project involves multiple robots cooperating to move objects in realistic scenarios, the most suitable simulators would be:

### 🥇 PyBullet (Highly Recommended)

 - Easy Python API, excellent integration with RL.

 - Stable physics engine (Bullet Physics) for realistic robot-object interactions.

 - Commonly used in MARL & robot learning research.

 - Lightweight and efficient—perfect for rapid RL training iterations.

Use if prioritizing:

 - Simplicity & rapid prototyping.

 - Extensive RL support (many tutorials and examples available).

 - Faster training cycles.


Final Recommendation:
👉 PyBullet is typically preferred for RL-based projects due to its ease of use, speed, and RL-friendly features.

## 2. Recommended Python RL Libraries
For  MARL implementation, you’ll need libraries that are powerful, well-supported, and widely used in RL research. Here's the ideal stack:

### 🥇 PyTorch (Must-have)
 - Powerful deep learning framework, intuitive for creating complex neural networks for RL policies.
 - Strong industry and research community support.
 - Easy debugging and experimentation, crucial for MARL.

### 🥇 Stable-Baselines3 (Highly Recommended for Single-Agent RL, extensible to MARL)
 - Easy-to-use implementations of popular RL algorithms (PPO, DDPG, SAC).
 - Built on top of PyTorch.
 - Stable, well-documented, ideal for prototyping policies quickly.
 - However, Stable-Baselines3 is primarily single-agent focused; you'd need extensions for MARL.

### 🥇 PettingZoo (Best for MARL)
 - PettingZoo extends OpenAI Gym environments for MARL.
 - Provides various multi-agent environment examples.
 - Easy integration with Stable-Baselines3 or custom PyTorch-based algorithms.

### 🥇 NumPy (Essential)
 - Used for numerical operations and state/action space handling.
 - Fundamental in virtually all RL implementations.
